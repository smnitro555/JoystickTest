# JoystickTest

This app is designed to showcase two joysticks and have two values generated from them, an X Percentage (positive and negative)
and a Y Percentage (positive and negative) from the JoystickView Class. 



I did not create the JoystickView Class, that was created by zerokol. I am using his code for the classes in accordance with 
github policy.
